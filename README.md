Default Zus repo files. Any file included in
[this list](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/setting-up-your-project-for-healthy-contributions/creating-a-default-community-health-file)
will be used as the default file for all repos in the zeus-health organization. If an individual
repo has their own copy of the file, then the repo copy of the file will override the file in this
repo
